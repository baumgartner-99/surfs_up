# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview
This project contains code to find summary statistics regarding temperature trends on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, the months June and December over many years are reported.

## Results
Looking at the June and December temperature summary statistics, we can conclude the following information: 

- The average temperature in June on the island of Oahu is 75 degrees.
- The average temperature in December on the island of Oahu is 71 degrees.
- The record coldest temperature in December on Oahu, according to the data we have, is 56 degrees.

## Summary
From these summary statistics, it is safe to say that Oahu generally maintains a temperature in the low 70s during peak months of the year, June and December. Another interesting query to perform would be to look at the precipitation levels throughout those two months, especially in December when most northern hemisphere cities in the US tend to experience winter. Furthermore, it could be useful to dive deeper into the reporting data on the weather stations during those months. Does holiday or summer travel impact the frequency of station weather reports?
